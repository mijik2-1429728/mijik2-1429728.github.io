		Drumheller Fountain is the centerpiece of Rainier Vista, perfectly framed by rose gardens, a long walkway of trees and halls and Mount Rainier in the distance. 
		Drumheller was originally called Geyser Basin when the UW campus held the Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition in 1906. 
		After the exposition, it earned the name “Frosh Pond” for an early college tradition of tossing unsuspecting freshman into its waters. 
		Other uses of the pond have included student log rolling contests and a common spot for ducks and geese.
